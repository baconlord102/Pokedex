## 📘 Pokédex

## Overview:

Pokédex is a JavaScript-based application that displays Pokémon information in a structured, visually themed interface. The project focuses on rendering structured data dynamically and presenting it in a way that mirrors a real-world reference application.

This project emphasizes data-driven UI rendering and clean separation between data and presentation logic.

## Features:

Display a list of Pokémon

Show Pokémon details dynamically

Themed interface inspired by the Pokédex concept

Responsive layout for different screen sizes

## Tech Stack:

HTML5 – application structure

CSS3 – layout, styling, and theming

JavaScript (ES6) – data handling and DOM rendering

## How to Run Locally:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/baconlord102/pokedex.git


Navigate into the project directory

Open index.html in your browser

No backend or build tools required.

## Application Logic:

Pokémon data is loaded and stored in JavaScript objects or arrays

The UI is generated dynamically from data rather than static HTML

Event listeners control user interaction and updates

Rendering logic updates the DOM based on selected Pokémon

## What This Project Demonstrates:

Data-driven rendering with JavaScript

Mapping structured data to UI components

DOM manipulation and event handling

Consistent UI theming and layout control

Scalable project structure for future expansion

## Future Improvements:

Integrate a public Pokémon API

Add search and filtering functionality

Add pagination or lazy loading

Improve accessibility and keyboard navigation

Expand Pokémon detail views

## Purpose:

This project was built to practice working with structured datasets and rendering dynamic content. It serves as a strong foundation for future applications involving APIs, asynchronous JavaScript, and larger data sets.
